# cdac-project

The aim of this project is to design and implement an embedded Ethernet-based communication system for transmitting RFID data from a microcontroller-based node to a Linux-based processing platform. The project focuses on interfacing an RFID module with an STM32 microcontroller, enabling Ethernet connectivity using an external Ethernet controller, and implementing lightweight network communication using the LWIP stack and UDP protocol. The objective is to achieve efficient, reliable, and low-latency data transfer suitable for real-time embedded applications.
